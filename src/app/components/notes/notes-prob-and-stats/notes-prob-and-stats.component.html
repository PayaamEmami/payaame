  <h2 class="underline">One-way data</h2>
  <p class="indent">
    One-way data, in comparison to two-way data, contains a
    single individual, that has properties (variables) attached
    to it.
  </p>
  <p class="indent">
    Individuals are items in a data set and can be cases, things,
    people, etc.
  </p>
  <p class="indent">
    Variables are properties that describe individuals.
    Variables can be categorical or quantitative:
  </p>
  <ul class="indent">
    <li>Categorical variables are non-numerical values</li>
    <li>Quantitative variables are numerical values</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="indent">
    Together, <strong>individuals</strong> and
    <strong>variables</strong> are called
    <strong>data</strong>.<br>
  </p>
  <h2 class="underline">Bar graphs and pie charts</h2>
  <img src="./../../../assets/img/stats/BarGraph.png">
  <p class="indent">
    Bar graphs are best for representing data that isn't
    connected, more categorical data.
  </p>
  <img src="./../../../assets/img/stats/HorizontalBarGraph.png">
  <p class="indent">
    For horizontal bar graphs, it's common to put in
    descending order.
  </p>
  <img src="./../../../assets/img/stats/PieChart.png">
  <p class="indent">
    Pie charts are best for when comparing parts of a whole.
  </p>
  <h2 class="underline">Line graphs and ogives</h2>
  <img src="./../../../assets/img/stats/LineGraph.png">
  <p class="indent">
    Line graphs are best for representing change over time,
    so we can see how a variable moves up or down, and we can
    see the rate of change between two data points.
  </p>
  <img src="./../../../assets/img/stats/Ogive.png">
  <p class="indent">
    Ogives are best for when you want to show an accumulated total,
    you can see rate of change between each data point as well as
    the accumulated total over time.
  </p>
  <h2 class="underline">Two-way data</h2>
  <p class="indent">
    Data that is dependent on more than one individual.
  </p>
  <p class="indent">
    We talk about two-way data in terms of independent and
    dependent variables.
  </p>
  <ul class="indent">
    <li>Independent variables are individuals such as cases,
      things, people, etc</li>
    <li>Dependent variables are variables that describe
      independent variables
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="indent">
    In one-way data, we have one independent variable
    (individual) and one or more dependent variables (variables).
  </p>
  <h2 class="underline">Venn diagrams</h2>
  <img src="./../../../assets/img/stats/VennDiagram.png">
  <p class="indent">
    Two-way data can be represented as a venn diagram.
  </p>
  <h2 class="underline">Frequency tables and dot plots</h2>
  <img src="./../../../assets/img/stats/FrequencyTable.png">
  <p class="indent">
    Frequency tables display how frequently or infrequently
    something occurs.
  </p>
  <img src="./../../../assets/img/stats/DotPlot.png">
  <p class="indent">
    Dot plots can be used to display frequency of small data
    sets.
  </p>
  <h2 class="underline">Relative frequency tables</h2>
  <img src="./../../../assets/img/stats/RelativeFrequencyTable.png">
  <p class="indent">
    Relative frequency tables are tables that display
    percentages instead of actual counts.
  </p>
  <img src="./../../../assets/img/stats/RelativeFrequencyTableColumn.png">
  <br>
  <img src="./../../../assets/img/stats/RelativeFrequencyTableRow.png">
  <p class="indent">
    Column-relative frequency and row-relative frequency are
    tables in which the summation of the total column or
    total row equates to 1.
  </p>
  <img src="./../../../assets/img/stats/RelativeFrequencyTableTotal.png">
  <p class="indent">
    Total relative frequency tables are calculated for a
    two-way table by dividing every cell by the grand total.
  </p>
  <h2 class="underline">Joint distributions</h2>
  <img src="./../../../assets/img/stats/JointDistribution.png">
  <p class="indent">
    Joint distribution tables contain percentages comparing
    one data set to another.
  </p>
  <img src="./../../../assets/img/stats/MarginalDistribution.png">
  <p class="indent">
    Marginal distribution is the total column or total row
    in a joint distribution.
  </p>
  <img src="./../../../assets/img/stats/ConditionalDistribution.png">
  <p class="indent">
    Conditional distribution is the distribution of one
    variable, given the particular value of another variable.
  </p>
  <h2 class="underline">Histograms and stem-and-leaf plots</h2>
  <img src="./../../../assets/img/stats/Histogram.png">
  <p class="indent">
    A histogram, AKA a frequency histogram, is just like
    a bar graph, except we collect the data into buckets
    and then sketch a bar for each bucket.
  </p>
  <p class="indent">
    The way the data is spread out is called a distribution.<br>
    As a general rule, qualitative data is usually better for
    a bar graph and quantitative data is usually better in a
    histogram.
  </p>
  <img src="./../../../assets/img/stats/StemPlot.png">
  <p class="indent">
    A stem-and-leaf plot, AKA stem plot, is just another way
    to summarize data.
  </p>
  <h2 class="underline">Box-and-whisker plots</h2>
  <img src="./../../../assets/img/stats/BoxAndWhiskerPlot.png">
  <p class="indent">
    Box-and-whisker plots (also called box plots) are a great way to represent
    a data set when you want to show the median and spread of the data at the
    same time.
  </p>
  <p class="indent">
    The five-number summary, also called the five-figure summary, for any set
    of data will include the minimum and maximum values, the median, and
    Q<sub>1</sub> and Q<sub>3</sub> for the data set. We usually give the
    five-number summary in a table, and we can easily gather all of this
    information from a box-plot.

  <h2 class="underline">Measures of central tendency</h2>
  <p class="indent">
    <strong>Measures of central tendency</strong> are different ways we've come
    up with to describe the middle, center, or most typical value of the data.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Mean</li>
    <img src="./../../../assets/img/stats/PopulationMean.png">
    <p class="indent">
      We usually say "average" but technically we're thinking about mean, also
      called the arithmetic mean. The formula can be simplified to the sum of
      all the data points divided by the number of data points. We usually denote
      the mean with the greek symbol μ (pronounced "mew").
    </p>
    <li>Median</li>
    <p class="indent">
      The median of a data set is the value we get when we line up all the data
      points in the set from least to greatest, and then we look at the number or
      pair of numbers in the middle.
    </p>
    <li>Mode</li>
    <p class="indent">
      The mode of a data set is the value that occurs most often, more than any
      other value. You could think about it as the most typical value in the set.
      If a data set has two modes (a tie between two values that occur the most),
      we call the data set <strong>bi-modal</strong>. Note, others would say the
      data set has no mode, instead of bi-modal.
    </p>
  </ul>
  <h2 class="underline">Measures of dispersion</h2>
  <p class="indent">
    <strong>Measures of dispersion</strong> or <strong>scatter</strong>
    describe how and by how much our data set is spread out around its center.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Range</li>
    <p class="indent">
      The range of a data set is the difference between the largest value and
      the smallest value.
    </p>
    <li>Interquartile range (IQR)</li>
    <p class="indent">
      The interquartile range is the difference between the median of the
      upper half and the median of the lower half (of the data set).
    </p>
  </ul>
  <h2 class="underline">Outlier</h2>
  <p class="indent">
    A number on the extreme upper end or extreme lower end of a data set.
  </p>

    A <strong>population</strong> is the entire group of subjects that we're
    interested in. A <strong>sample</strong> is just a sub-section of the
    population.

  <p class="indent">
    The mean of a population is:

    The mean of a sample is:
  </p>
  <img src="./../../../assets/img/stats/SampleMean.png">
  <p class="indent">
    The mean of a population is still defined as μ, but we'll define the mean
    of a sample with x̄ (pronounced "x-bar").
